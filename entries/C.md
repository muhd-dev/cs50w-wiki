# C Programming

C is a **general-purpose programming language** that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, operating systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like the **Oracle database**, [Git](/wiki/Git), and the [Python](/wiki/Python) interpreter.

## Features of C

C offers several features that make it a powerful and versatile programming language:

- **Low-Level and High-Level**: C provides low-level access to memory and hardware, allowing for efficient system programming. However, it also supports high-level abstractions, making it suitable for application development.

- **Portability**: Code written in C can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes, thanks to its machine-independent nature.

- **Efficiency**: C is known for its efficient and fast execution, making it a preferred choice for system-level programming and embedded systems.

- **Rich Standard Library**: C comes with a rich standard library that provides functions for various tasks, making development faster and more convenient.

## Usage

C is used in a wide range of applications, including:

- **Operating Systems**: Many operating systems, including Windows and Unix-based systems, are written in C.

- **Database Systems**: C is used to build database management systems like the **Oracle database**.

- **Git**: The version control system [Git](/wiki/Git) is implemented in C.

- **Python Interpreter**: Parts of the [Python](/wiki/Python) interpreter are written in C, contributing to its speed and efficiency.

C's combination of power, simplicity, and versatility has solidified its place as a fundamental language in the world of programming.

## Example Code Snippets

        ```c
        // The classic "Hello, World!" program in C prints a message to the console.
        #include <stdio.h>

        int main() {
            printf("Hello, World!\n");
            return 0;
        }
        ```

# Django Web Framework

**Django** is a powerful web framework written in [Python](/wiki/Python) that enables developers to create web applications capable of dynamically generating [HTML](/wiki/HTML) content. It is designed to simplify and streamline web development by providing a robust set of tools and features.

## Key Features

Django offers a wide range of features that make it a popular choice for web development:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django's ORM allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects, making database management and querying more intuitive and less error-prone.

- **Security**: Django includes built-in security features such as protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- **Scalability**: Django is designed to handle projects of all sizes. It can scale from small personal websites to large, high-traffic web applications.

- **Versatile Template System**: Django's template engine makes it easy to generate dynamic HTML content and separate design from logic.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Built-in user authentication and authorization features simplify user management and access control.

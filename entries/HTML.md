# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

**HTML**, short for **Hypertext Markup Language**, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. It is a markup language used to define the structure and content of web pages. HTML allows web developers to create documents with text, images, links, forms, and other elements that are displayed in web browsers.

## Key Concepts

HTML documents consist of a series of elements, each represented by a pair of tags. Some of the essential HTML elements include:

- **Headings**: Used to define headings and subheadings on a web page. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).

- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` tags are used to create paragraphs of text on a web page, helping organize and format content.

- **Lists**: HTML supports both ordered lists `<ol>` (numbered lists) and unordered lists `<ul>` (bullet-point lists) to structure information.

- **Links**: `<a>` tags create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other web pages or resources. Links are a fundamental part of the web's interconnected nature.

- **Images**: `<img>` tags are used to embed images in web pages, enhancing visual content.

- **Forms**: HTML `<form>` elements enable the collection of user input, making interactions like submitting contact forms or conducting surveys possible.

HTML5, the most recent major version of HTML, introduced many new features and elements that enhance web development capabilities. It offers support for multimedia (audio and video), advanced form controls, local storage, and more, making web applications more powerful and interactive.

## Structuring Web Pages

HTML serves as the structural framework for web pages. It defines the hierarchy and arrangement of elements, allowing browsers to render content appropriately. Properly structured HTML is critical for accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and responsive web design.

Here's a simple example of HTML structure which includes the basic components: <html>, <head>, and <body> elements. It also contains headings, paragraphs, a list, and a hyperlink.:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```
